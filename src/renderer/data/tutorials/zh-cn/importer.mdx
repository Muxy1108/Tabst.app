# Importer

When importing alphaTex into alphaTab it directly loads the provided code and, if successful, provides the loaded [data model](https://alphatab.net/docs/reference/score).
Using the alphatex importer and parser more directly, allows access to more detailed information like the abstract syntax tree. 

This information can be very useful when building certain tooling and integrations. The [alphaTab language server](https://alphatab.net/docs/alphatex/lsp) itself also uses these components.

> [!NOTE]
> The code samples here are written in TypeScript but the APIs are similar on C# and Kotlin and can easily be mapped by adjusting the naming conventions. 

## Importer

The importer is the main component for loading alphaTex into a full [data model](https://alphatab.net/docs/reference/score). It is available via `alphaTab.importers.AlphaTexImporter`. 
The most basic usage of it is:

```js
// create importer
const importer = new alphaTab.importer.AlphaTabImporter();
importer.initFromString(`
\\title "Hello World"
C4 * 4
`, new alphaTab.Settings());
// load score
const score = importer.readScore();

console.log(score.title); // will print "Hello World"
```
