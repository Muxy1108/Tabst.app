# Note Properties

The properties defined on note level result in a variety of effects and annotations
shown in the music sheet. Historically these properties are heavily abbreviated to
reduce the text that needs to be written to apply them.

In future alphaTab will likely change to a more verbose, but clearer alternative.

## `nh`

```markdown
nh ()
```

**Description:** Applies a natural harmonic effect to the note (for fretted instruments).

**Example:**

```alphatex
:8 3.3{nh} 3.3{ah} 3.3{ph} 3.3{th} 3.3{sh}
```
