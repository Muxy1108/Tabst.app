# Bars

# Document Structure



An alphaTex file is simply a list of bars and every bar has metadata and contents. For organizational reasons we commend
that metadata tags describing the general song information are added to the start of the file, and external media synchronization points are 
added on the end of the file: 

```title=General File Structure
/* Song Metadata */
/* Song Contents */
/* Sync Points */
```

:::note
Before alphaTex 1.7 the 3 sections needed to be separated by a `.` This was improved in 1.7 and the separation dots should now be omitted.

```title=Pre 1.7 General File Structure
/* Song Metadata */
.
/* Song Contents */
.
/* Sync Points */
```

# Bars

Bars (aka. measures) are starting with an optional list of metadata tags followed by the beats contained
in the bar. See [Bar Metadata](https://alphatab.net/docs/alphatex/bar-metadata) for details on the tags which can be applied here.

A bar is completed by a pipe `|` symbol


```alphatex
// bar 1 metadata tags
\\clef G2 \\ks 
    // bar 1 contents
    Cb C4 
|  
// bar 2 metadata tags
\\ks A
    // bar 2 contents
    C4
```


## Beats

Beats group a number of notes played at the same time. The general parts of a beat are 

* `duration-change content duration effects multiplier`



```alphatex
:4
    C4
    (C4 D4).8
    (C4 D4) { f }
    C4.16 * 2
    C4.4
```


### Duration change (optional)

A duration change allows easy changing of the duration for all following beats. The syntax is:

`:Duration` where `Duration` is a number describing the new duration:
* `:-4` a Quadruple Whole Note
* `:-2` a Double Note 
* `:1` a Whole Note
* `:2` a Half Note
* `:4` a Quarter Note 
* `:8` a 8th Note 
* `:16` a 16th Note
* `:32` a 32th Note
* `:64` a 64th Note
* `:128` a 128th Note 
* `:256` a 256th Note 

Optionally you can specify some properties afterwards the duration to specify tuplets.  

`:4 {tu 3 2}`

See [Tuplet Effect](https://alphatab.net/docs/alphatex/beat-properties#tu) for more details.


```alphatex
:16 // 16th notes from here
    3.3
    4.3 
    5.3
    6.3
:4 { tu 3 } // quarter notes triplets
    3.3
    4.3
    5.3
:8 
    3.3 * 3
```
